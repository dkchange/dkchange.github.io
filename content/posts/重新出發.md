    我幾乎忘記自己為什麼放棄繼續當工程師這條路了，是因為AI?還是單純我只是太懶?走在溫哥華市中心的街道上，感覺失去人生的方向，加拿大生活成本真的高，現在吃個東西還要斤斤計較價錢，人生這條路是不是走得有點歪。
    已經好長的時間沒有寫代碼了，我覺得自己好像是躺在床上兩年的病人，好不真實，當我開始寫代碼，打開編輯器的瞬間，所有的東西都讓我覺得熟悉，同時又很陌生，看來離開工作兩年過退休生活就是有這樣的影響，值得嗎?可能吧?但我一定需要時間來恢復`,找回我忘記的事和追上我被遠遠拋在後面的那條路，是時後重新出發了

    I almost forgot why I gave up the path of continuing to be an software developer. Was it because of AI? Or was it simply because I was too lazy? Walking down the streets of downtown Vancouver, I felt like I had lost the direction of my life. The cost of living in Canada is really high. Now even eating something requires carefully calculating the price. Am I walking down the wrong path in life?  
    It has been such a long time since I last wrote code. I feel like a patient who has been lying in bed for two years—it feels so unreal. When I started coding and opened the editor, everything felt familiar yet strange at the same time. It seems that leaving work for two years to live a retired life has had this kind of impact on me. Was it worth it? Maybe. But I definitely need time to recover, to regain what I’ve forgotten, and to catch up on the path I’ve been left far behind on. It’s time to start over.
